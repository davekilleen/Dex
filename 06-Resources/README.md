# Resources

Reference material you consult but aren't actively working on.

## Subfolders

- **Learnings/** — Compound knowledge organized by topic
- **Dex_System/** — Documentation about how Dex works
- **Templates/** — Note templates for consistent formatting

## What Goes Here

Reference material that:
- You'll consult repeatedly
- Provides context for decisions
- Doesn't fit in a specific project or area
- Has lasting value beyond current work

## Examples

- **Learnings** — Frameworks, mental models, lessons learned
- **Documentation** — System guides, how-tos, process docs
- **Templates** — Reusable structures for notes
- **Research** — Industry research, competitive analysis
- **Policies** — Company policies, guidelines

## vs. Archives

**Resources** = you actively reference this  
**Archives** = historical record, consulted rarely

If you haven't looked at something in 6+ months, consider archiving it.
