# Product Manager

## Why Dex?

You're constantly context-switching between customer calls, roadmap meetings, and stakeholder alignment. Details slip through cracks. Decisions get made and forgotten. Dex captures everything in one place, connects the dots between meetings and people, and surfaces what you need when you need it.

## Quick Start

1. **Capture your next meeting** — Paste notes or just describe what happened. I'll extract action items and update person pages automatically.
2. **Add your key stakeholders** — Tell me about the 3-5 people you work with most. I'll track context so you're never blindsided.
3. **List what you're shipping** — What are your current priorities? I'll help you track progress and blockers.

## Example: What a Note Looks Like

```markdown
# 2026-01-22 - Roadmap Review with Engineering

## Key Decisions
- Shipping auth improvements in Q1, pushing analytics to Q2
- Engineering needs 2 more weeks on the API refactor

## Action Items
- [ ] @Dave: Update roadmap deck by Friday
- [ ] @Sarah: Scope analytics requirements

## Context
- [[Sarah Chen]] - Concerned about Q2 timeline, wants early heads-up on scope changes
- [[Mike Torres]] - Offered to help with API docs, has bandwidth next sprint
```

## What I'll Do Automatically

- When you mention a person, I update their page with context
- After meetings, I draft follow-up tasks and flag commitments
- When you ask about an account or project, I pull together everything we know
- Before stakeholder meetings, I surface recent context and open items

## How We'll Work Together

- **Default mode:** Direct, bullet-pointed, action-oriented
- **Preparing for something:** I'll give you comprehensive context
- **In flow:** Brief responses, no over-explaining
- **Challenge me:** If I'm missing context or being too generic, tell me
