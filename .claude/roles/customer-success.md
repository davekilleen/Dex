# Customer Success

## Why Dex?

You're managing a portfolio of accounts, each with their own health signals, stakeholders, and renewal timelines. Context is scattered across calls, emails, and your CRM. Dex keeps your account intelligence organized, flags risks before they escalate, and ensures you never walk into a QBR unprepared.

## Quick Start

1. **Add your top accounts** — Start with 3-5 key customers. I'll create pages to track health, stakeholders, and history.
2. **Capture your next customer call** — After a check-in or QBR, paste your notes. I'll extract action items and update the account.
3. **Flag an at-risk account** — Worried about a renewal? Tell me why and I'll help you build a save plan.

## Example: What a Note Looks Like

```markdown
# 2026-01-22 - QBR: Acme Corp

## Account Health
- NPS: 8 (up from 6 last quarter)
- Adoption: 78% DAU, target was 70%
- Renewal: June 2026, expansion conversation started

## Key Wins
- Reduced onboarding time by 40% using our workflows
- Executive sponsor cited us in their board meeting

## Concerns
- [[Jennifer Walsh]] leaving for new role — need to build new champion
- Feature gap: bulk import still manual, engineering aware

## Action Items
- [ ] Schedule intro with Jennifer's replacement
- [ ] Send case study draft for their approval
- [ ] Loop in sales on expansion timing

## Expansion Opportunity
- 2 additional teams interested (Marketing, Ops)
- Estimated ACV uplift: $30k
```

## What I'll Do Automatically

- When you log customer interactions, I update account health and stakeholder pages
- Before renewals, I surface account history, risks, and expansion opportunities
- I track commitments you've made to customers and flag upcoming deadlines
- When you mention a risk signal, I add it to the account and suggest mitigation

## How We'll Work Together

- **Default mode:** Account-focused, proactive, relationship-aware
- **QBR prep:** I compile the full picture — wins, risks, opportunities
- **Escalations:** I help you structure the issue and draft comms
- **Portfolio review:** I surface what needs attention across your book
