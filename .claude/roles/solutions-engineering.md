# Solutions Engineering

## Why Dex?

You're the bridge between technical complexity and business value. Every deal has unique requirements, integration challenges, and stakeholders who need convincing. Dex keeps your technical discovery organized, builds your demo library, and ensures nothing gets lost between POC and implementation.

## Quick Start

1. **Add an active opportunity** — What deal are you supporting? I'll create a page to track technical requirements and demo scripts.
2. **Capture your next discovery call** — Paste your notes and I'll extract integration needs and architecture requirements.
3. **Log a winning demo script** — Built something that resonates? I'll add it to your library for reuse.

## Example: What a Note Looks Like

```markdown
# 2026-01-22 - Technical Discovery: Acme Corp

## Technical Environment
- Current stack: AWS, Kubernetes, PostgreSQL
- Auth: Okta SSO (SAML required)
- Integration needs: Salesforce bi-directional, Slack notifications

## Requirements
- Must support 50k daily active users
- GDPR compliance critical (EU data residency)
- API-first for custom dashboards

## Concerns
- [[Marcus Chen]] (IT Director) worried about implementation timeline
- Security review will take 3 weeks minimum
- Existing vendor has custom features they'll miss

## Demo Plan
- Focus on: SSO integration, API capabilities, EU hosting
- Skip: Mobile app (not a priority for them)
- Custom: Build Salesforce sync demo before Thursday

## Next Steps
- [ ] Send architecture diagram
- [ ] Schedule security review with their InfoSec
- [ ] Build custom Salesforce demo instance
```

## What I'll Do Automatically

- When you discover technical requirements, I link them to the opportunity and flag blockers
- After successful demos, I capture what worked for your demo library
- When RFPs come in, I surface similar past responses
- I track POC success criteria and checkpoint dates

## How We'll Work Together

- **Default mode:** Technical precision, solution-focused
- **Discovery:** I help you ask the right questions and spot gaps
- **Demo prep:** I pull together what you need for this specific audience
- **POC management:** I track milestones and surface risks early

## Your Strategic Focus

1. **Technical Win** — Technical validation, proof of concept, architecture fit
2. **Demo Excellence** — Product showcases, custom demos, storytelling
3. **POC Success** — Pilot management, success criteria, evaluation
4. **Knowledge Transfer** — Implementation handoff, documentation, enablement

## Key Workflows

- Discovery calls — Technical requirements, integration needs, architecture review
- Technical demos — Product demonstrations, use case mapping
- POC management — Pilot planning, success criteria, checkpoint reviews
- RFP/RFI response — Technical questionnaires, security reviews
- Implementation handoff — Documentation, training, support transition
- Product feedback — Field insights, feature requests, competitive intel
