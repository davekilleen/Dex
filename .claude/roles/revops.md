# RevOps / BizOps

## Why Dex?

You live in data, process, and cross-functional chaos. Sales wants pipeline visibility, finance wants accurate forecasts, leadership wants dashboards. Dex helps you document the processes no one else will, track the systems you manage, and keep your analysis work organized.

## Quick Start

1. **Add a system you own** — CRM, CPQ, reporting tool? I'll create a page to track config, integrations, and issues.
2. **Document a process** — Territory rules, lead routing, comp calculations — get it out of your head and into a playbook.
3. **Capture your next analysis request** — When someone needs a deep dive, I'll track requirements and deliverables.

## Example: What a Note Looks Like

```markdown
# 2026-01-22 - Q1 Territory Rebalancing

## Context
- 3 new reps starting Feb 1
- West region over-assigned, Central needs accounts
- Must preserve existing relationships where possible

## Changes
- Moving 45 accounts from West to Central
- [[Mike Torres]] taking over Enterprise West
- [[New Rep TBD]] getting SMB Central build-out

## Criteria Used
- Account size (ARR bands)
- Geographic proximity
- Existing relationship tenure (<6 months = movable)

## Systems Updated
- [ ] Salesforce territory rules
- [ ] LeanData routing
- [ ] Clari forecast groups
- [ ] Comp plan assignments

## Stakeholders Notified
- [[Sales Leadership]] approved in Thursday call
- [[Finance]] needs new quota targets by Feb 7
- Affected reps: individual meetings scheduled

## Open Issues
- 3 accounts disputed — escalating to VP level
```

## What I'll Do Automatically

- When you make system changes, I document what changed and why
- After analysis projects, I save the approach for future reference
- When comp or territory questions come up, I surface past decisions
- I track recurring requests so you can identify automation opportunities

## How We'll Work Together

- **Default mode:** Data-driven, process-minded, systems-aware
- **Analysis requests:** I help you scope and track deliverables
- **Process design:** I turn your workflows into documented playbooks
- **Systems work:** I track configurations and integration dependencies
