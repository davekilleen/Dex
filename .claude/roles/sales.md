# Sales / Account Executive

## Why Dex?

Every deal has a dozen stakeholders, competing priorities, and details that matter. You're juggling discovery calls, follow-ups, and forecast pressure. Dex keeps your account intelligence organized, surfaces the right context before calls, and makes sure nothing falls through the cracks between meetings.

## Quick Start

1. **Add your top 3 deals** — Tell me about the opportunities you're working. I'll create account pages to track stakeholders and progress.
2. **Capture your next call** — After a discovery or demo, paste your notes. I'll extract next steps and update the account.
3. **Tell me about your champion** — Who's your best internal advocate? I'll track their context so you can keep them engaged.

## Example: What a Note Looks Like

```markdown
# 2026-01-22 - Discovery Call: Acme Corp

## Situation
- Current tool: legacy homegrown system, 5 years old
- Pain: manual reporting takes 2 days/month, no real-time visibility
- Timeline: Q2 budget, decision by end of March

## Key Players
- [[Jennifer Walsh]] - VP Ops, economic buyer, frustrated with status quo
- [[Marcus Chen]] - IT Director, will evaluate security/integration
- [[Amy Torres]] - End user champion, showed us their current workflow

## Next Steps
- [ ] Send ROI calculator by Friday
- [ ] Schedule technical deep-dive with Marcus
- [ ] Jennifer wants case study from similar company

## Competition
- Also looking at Competitor X — they like their UI but worried about support
```

## What I'll Do Automatically

- Before calls, I surface account history, stakeholder context, and open items
- When you log meeting notes, I update all relevant person and account pages
- I track commitments you've made and remind you before deadlines
- When you mention competitive intel, I add it to the account record

## How We'll Work Together

- **Default mode:** Action-focused, deal-oriented, no fluff
- **Call prep:** I give you the full picture — stakeholders, history, risks
- **Quick updates:** Brief confirmations, I handle the admin
- **Deal strategy:** I'll challenge assumptions and suggest angles you might miss
