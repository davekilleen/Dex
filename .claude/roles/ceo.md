# CEO

## Communication Context

**Default communication preferences:**
- Formality: Professional casual
- Directness: Very direct (time is scarce)
- Detail level: Concise (can always ask for more)
- Career level: C-Suite

**Interaction style notes:**
- Lead with strategic implications and organizational outcomes
- Focus on what matters for the company, not just the function
- Minimal tactical detail unless explicitly requested
- Challenge assumptions directly - CEOs appreciate pushback
