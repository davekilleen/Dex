# Finance

## Why Dex?

You're juggling close cycles, forecasts, board reports, and ad-hoc requests from every department. Context lives in spreadsheets, emails, and meetings. Dex keeps your analyses organized, tracks recurring processes, and ensures you're never scrambling before a board meeting.

## Quick Start

1. **Add your current close cycle** — What period are you closing? I'll create a page to track the checklist and open items.
2. **Document a recurring analysis** — Got a variance analysis you do monthly? Tell me the approach and I'll template it.
3. **Capture your next business partner meeting** — Finance is everyone's partner. I'll track requests and commitments.

## Example: What a Note Looks Like

```markdown
# 2026-01-22 - January Close Status

## Close Progress
- [x] Revenue recognition complete
- [x] Payroll accruals posted
- [ ] Commission accrual — waiting on final calc from RevOps
- [ ] Prepaid amortization review
- [ ] Intercompany elimination

## Open Items
- Commission calc delayed — [[Sarah Kim]] sending by EOD
- One vendor invoice missing (~$15k) — AP following up
- Engineering expense coding issue — need to reclassify $8k

## Variance Notes (vs. Budget)
- Revenue +3% — strong deal close in final week
- S&M -5% — open headcount not filled
- R&D +2% — contractor overage, approved by CTO

## Board Prep Items
- [ ] Update cash flow forecast
- [ ] Finalize Q1 guidance
- [ ] Prepare headcount bridge
```

## What I'll Do Automatically

- When close cycles start, I pull up last period's issues and your checklist
- After business partner meetings, I track requests and follow-ups
- When you do variance analysis, I save the narrative for board prep
- I remind you of recurring deadlines (close, forecast, board reports)

## How We'll Work Together

- **Default mode:** Precise, deadline-aware, executive-ready
- **Close period:** I help you track every item and escalate blockers
- **Analysis work:** I structure findings into clear narratives
- **Board prep:** I compile context from the month into a coherent story
