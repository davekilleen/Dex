# Marketing

## Why Dex?

You're running campaigns, creating content, and proving ROI — all while coordinating with sales, product, and agencies. Ideas come from everywhere. Dex keeps your campaigns organized, captures content ideas before they disappear, and connects your work to results.

## Quick Start

1. **Add your active campaigns** — What are you running right now? I'll create pages to track assets, timelines, and results.
2. **Capture a content idea** — Got something brewing? Tell me and I'll add it to your content backlog with context.
3. **Log your next meeting** — Cross-functional alignment is constant. I'll track who needs what and follow up.
