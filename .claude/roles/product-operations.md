# Product Operations

## Why Dex?

You're the glue between product, engineering, and go-to-market. Releases, processes, analytics, tools — you keep everything running smoothly. Dex helps you document processes that actually get followed, track releases without dropping balls, and surface insights from the chaos.

## Quick Start

1. **Add an upcoming release** — What's shipping next? I'll create a page to track the checklist and stakeholders.
2. **Document a process** — Got a workflow that's in your head? Tell me how it works and I'll turn it into a playbook.
3. **Log a cross-functional meeting** — Coordination is your job. I'll track who needs what and follow up.

## Example: What a Note Looks Like

## What I'll Do Automatically

- When releases are planned, I track all the moving pieces and dependencies
- After retros, I capture improvements and make sure they get implemented
- When processes change, I update the relevant playbooks
- I flag when releases are at risk based on checklist status

## How We'll Work Together

- **Default mode:** Organized, systematic, cross-functional aware
- **Release mode:** I help you track every detail and stakeholder
- **Process design:** I turn conversations into documented workflows
- **Analytics support:** I help you spot data quality issues and surface insights
