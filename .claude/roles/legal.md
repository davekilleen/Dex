# Legal

## Why Dex?

You're reviewing contracts, tracking compliance, managing outside counsel, and advising every department. Context about past deals and decisions is scattered. Dex keeps your matters organized, builds your playbook of approved positions, and ensures you're never starting from scratch on similar issues.

## Quick Start

1. **Add an active contract** — What are you negotiating? I'll create a page to track redlines, positions, and approvals.
2. **Document a legal position** — Made a decision on acceptable terms? I'll add it to your playbook for consistency.
3. **Capture a compliance item** — New regulation or policy update? I'll track it and the required actions.

## Example: What a Note Looks Like

## What I'll Do Automatically

- When you negotiate contracts, I track positions for consistency across deals
- After closing matters, I save key terms and lessons for future reference
- When compliance requirements change, I track action items and deadlines
- I surface similar past deals when you're reviewing new agreements

## How We'll Work Together

- **Default mode:** Precise, risk-aware, business-enabling
- **Contract review:** I help you track redlines and approved positions
- **Compliance:** I organize requirements and track remediation
- **Advisory:** I help you explain legal positions in business terms
