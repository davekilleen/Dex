# People (HR)

## Why Dex?

You're managing hiring pipelines, employee issues, performance cycles, and culture initiatives — all while being the keeper of sensitive context. Dex helps you track candidate journeys, document important conversations, and keep programs on track without things slipping.

## Quick Start

1. **Add your open roles** — What positions are you hiring for? I'll create pages to track pipeline and interview feedback.
2. **Capture an important conversation** — Had a manager check-in or employee concern? I'll help you document it properly.
3. **Track a people program** — Performance cycle, engagement survey, or initiative? I'll help you manage the timeline.

## Example: What a Note Looks Like
