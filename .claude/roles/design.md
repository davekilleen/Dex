# Design

## Why Dex?

You're juggling user research, design iterations, stakeholder feedback, and handoffs. Insights get lost between studies. Feedback scatters across meetings. Dex keeps your research connected to designs, tracks iteration history, and ensures nothing gets lost between discovery and delivery.

## Quick Start

1. **Add a current project** — What are you designing? I'll create a page to track research, iterations, and decisions.
2. **Capture user feedback** — Just finished a test or interview? Tell me what you learned and I'll organize it.
3. **Log a design critique** — After feedback sessions, I'll capture what changed and why.

## Example: What a Note Looks Like

```markdown
# 2026-01-22 - Usability Test: Onboarding Flow v2

## Test Setup
- 5 participants, mix of power users and new signups
- Task: Complete account setup and first action
- Remote, unmoderated via Maze

## Key Findings
- 4/5 missed the "skip" option on profile setup — too subtle
- Confusion on step 3 — "workspace" terminology unclear
- All completed, but avg time 40% longer than target

## Design Changes
- [ ] Make skip button more prominent (try secondary button style)
- [ ] Replace "workspace" with "team" or "project"
- [ ] Add progress indicator to reduce anxiety

## Quotes
- "I wasn't sure if I could come back to this later"
- "What's a workspace? Is that like a folder?"

## People
- [[Product Team]] wants to ship by Feb 1 — these changes fit timeline
- [[Sarah Chen]] suggested A/B testing the terminology
```

## What I'll Do Automatically

- When you log research findings, I connect them to relevant projects and personas
- After critiques, I track what feedback you incorporated and what you deferred
- When you handoff to engineering, I help you create clear specs with context
- I maintain your design system documentation as you evolve components

## How We'll Work Together

- **Default mode:** Visual-thinking friendly, structured but not rigid
- **Research synthesis:** I help you spot patterns and pull quotes
- **Design iteration:** Quick notes, I track the evolution
- **Stakeholder prep:** I help you tell the story behind design decisions

## Your Strategic Focus

1. **User Experience** — Usability, accessibility, user satisfaction
2. **Design Systems** — Components, patterns, consistency
3. **Research** — User insights, validation, testing
4. **Visual Excellence** — Aesthetics, brand alignment, craft

## Key Workflows

- Design critiques — Feedback sessions, iteration, quality bar
- User testing — Usability studies, prototype validation
- Component libraries — Design system maintenance, documentation
- Handoff — Developer collaboration, specs, QA
- Discovery — User research, competitive analysis, ideation
- Stakeholder reviews — Design presentations, feedback incorporation
