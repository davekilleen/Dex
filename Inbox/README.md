# Inbox

Capture zone for everything that comes in during your day.

## What Goes Here

Quick captures before you've organized them:
- **Meetings/** — Meeting notes and summaries
- **Ideas/** — Random thoughts and ideas to process later

## Active File (Root)

`00-B-Week_Priorities/Week_Priorities.md` lives at the repo root—it's active state, not inbox capture.

## Philosophy

The inbox is for **capture, not organization**. Don't worry about structure—just get it down. Use `/triage` later to organize.

## Workflow

1. **Capture** — Drop everything here first
2. **Triage** — Run `/triage` to process and organize
3. **Move** — Files get routed to 01-Projects/, 02-Areas/, or 03-Resources/

## Inbox Zero

Aim to triage your inbox weekly. If something sits for 30+ days:
- Not important → delete
- Reference material → move to 03-Resources/
- Dormant project → archive

## vs. Archives

**Inbox** = transient, needs processing (days)  
**Archives** = permanent record (indefinitely)

Once triaged, files leave the inbox—either to active work or archives.
