# Session Learnings

This folder contains daily session learnings captured automatically during your work with Dex.

Each day gets a file: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`

These learnings are reviewed during:
- Weekly synthesis (`/week`)
- System improvement reviews (`/whats-new`)

The AI silently logs:
- Mistakes and how to avoid them
- Gaps in documentation
- User workflow patterns
- System improvement opportunities
