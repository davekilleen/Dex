## [15:45] - Folder Structure Refactoring Best Practices

**What happened:** Major refactoring (commit e6dff0a) added numeric prefixes to folders but left duplicates behind (Inbox/ + 00-Inbox/, 06-Resources/ + 03-Resources/). This created a confusing directory structure where GitHub showed both old and new folders.

**Why it matters:** 
- Breaks user onboarding when folder structure doesn't match documentation
- Creates confusion about which folder is authoritative
- Wrong PARA numbering (03-Resources conflicts with 03-Tasks)
- GitHub and local state inconsistent

**Suggested fix:** When renaming folders in bulk refactoring:
1. Use `git mv` to preserve history
2. Delete old folders in the **same commit** as creating new ones
3. Update ALL references (docs, skills, scripts, hooks) before committing
4. Verify final folder structure matches CLAUDE.md specification
5. Test folder paths in at least one skill before pushing

**Status:** fixed - Removed duplicates, standardized on 00-Inbox/ and 06-Resources/, updated all documentation and code references.
