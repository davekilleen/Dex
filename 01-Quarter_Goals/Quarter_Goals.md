# Quarter Goals — Q1 2026

## Objective 1: Make Invisible M1 Visible

**Pillar:** Shareholder Change

**Context:**
- M1 = Merchants with PrestaShop as CMS with CloudSync-measured annualized GMV > 1M€
- Monetized M1 = PS gains >5K ARR from that merchant
- Goal: Identify M1s flying under the radar and convert them to monetized M1s

### Key Results

| KR | Target | Current | Status |
|----|--------|---------|--------|
| KR1: Identify invisible M1s | TBD | — | 🔴 Not started |

### Next Actions
- [ ] Define "invisible" criteria (no contract? no support? no modules purchased?)
- [ ] Pull list of M1s from CloudSync data
- [ ] Cross-reference with current ARR per merchant
