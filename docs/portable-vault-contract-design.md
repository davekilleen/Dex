# Portable Vault Contract — PR-0 design (authored by orchestrator, 2026-07-20)

The shared spine for three tracks: Brain/Vault split (Decision B), the catalog upgrade
engine (Decision A), and capability rooms (Decision C). Spec source: the ratified
`Vault_Contract.md` v1 (2026-06-18, private handbook) reconciled with what has shipped
on main through v1.62.0 (SR1 #147–#150).

## Artifacts (mirrors the existing paths-contract idiom)

| Artifact | Role |
|---|---|
| `core/portable_contract.py` | Source of truth: the classification rules, five classes, capability registry, mutation policy; loader + resolution API |
| `scripts/generate-portable-contract.py` | Generator → committed dist JSON (like `generate-path-contracts.py`) |
| `packages/dex-contracts/dist/portable-vault.contract.json` | Generated, committed cross-repo view |
| `packages/dex-contracts/dist/portable-vault.schema.json` | JSON Schema validating the contract |
| `scripts/check-portable-contract.sh` | CI gate (see Gate) |
| `core/tests/test_portable_contract.py` | Unit + red-when-removed gate tests |

## Five ownership classes (from #141, reconciled with Vault_Contract §3)

- `brain` — release-owned; replaced wholesale on update. `core/`, `packages/`,
  `scripts/`, `extensions/`, shipped `.claude/` skills+hooks, `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`,
  system docs, `install.sh`.
- `vault` — user content; updates NEVER write. PARA folders (`00-Inbox/` … `07-Archives/`,
  ALL of `06-Resources/` per ratified decision §10.1 — brain docs eventually move to
  `docs/`), user config values (`System/user-profile.yaml`, `System/pillars.yaml`,
  `System/folder-paths.yaml`), user extensions (`CLAUDE-custom.md`,
  `.claude/skills-custom/`, `core/mcp-custom/`, `core/mcp-premium/`), `.mcp.json`.
- `seed` — shipped once, then user-owned; update writes ONLY if absent.
  Templates (`System/Templates/`), `System/user-profile-template.yaml` (canonical
  template on main; the ratified doc says `user-profile.example.yaml` — the repo
  consolidated to `-template` in the hygiene PR; contract follows the repo, deviation
  noted), `System/pillars.example.yaml`, `env.example`, `System/.mcp.json.example`,
  `System/integrations/config.yaml` + `slack.yaml` (SR1 #150: tracked templates carrying
  env-var references — NOT vault, NOT brain), `03-Tasks/Tasks.md` and other starter files.
- `generated` — machine-derived, regenerated; neither user- nor release-precious:
  `System/.installed-files.manifest`, `System/.release-evidence-profile.json`,
  `packages/dex-contracts/dist/*` (committed but regenerable), people/company indexes.
- `runtime` — local machine state; never shipped, never updated, may be gitignored:
  `System/.dex/`, `System/Session_Learnings/` (today: 3 legacy tracked files under
  SR1 #148's 27-row baseline — contract marks the DIRECTORY runtime with an explicit
  `legacy_tracked` exception list so the baseline reduction follow-up has one place to
  edit), `System/Session_Memory/`, `System/usage_log.md`, logs, caches, `node_modules`.

## Hard-deny list (write-plan may never target, any class)
`.env*`, `.git/`, `System/credentials/`, `*token.json`, `*.key`, `*.pem`, symlinks,
path traversal. (From #141 ownership.cjs deny set + Vault_Contract §3 secrets row.)

## Credential reconciliation (the SR1 collision, settled here)
- `System/integrations/config.yaml` = `seed` (shipped reference-schema template;
  install-if-absent; never overwritten once user-owned).
- `.mcp.json` = `vault` + `report_only: true` (SR1's structural residual detector owns
  it; no engine may rewrite it).
- Raw secret authority = vault-root `.env` (hard-deny).

## Capability registry (Decision C, Option 2)
Declarative rooms; the spine (meetings/people/tasks) is NOT a capability — always on.
```
capabilities:
  career:        { folders: [05-Areas/Career/], skills: [career-setup, career-coach, resume-builder], mcp: [career_server, resume_server], default: off }
  companies:     { folders: [05-Areas/Companies/], features: [entity-engine.company-pages], default: off }
  quarter_goals: { folders: [01-Quarter_Goals/], skills: [quarter-plan, quarter-review], config: quarterly_planning, default: off }
```
State lives in `System/user-profile.yaml` → `capabilities:` (vault-owned values), per
the portability audit — reusing the existing `quarterly_planning.enabled` precedent.
Contract rule: an absent room is VALID (repair/convergence must not recreate it).

## vault_schema
Declared in `System/user-profile.yaml` (`vault_schema: 1`); the contract JSON carries
`vault_schema_supported: ">=1 <2"`. Boot comparison semantics per Vault_Contract §6
(older → offer migrator; newer → refuse writes) — enforcement lands with the engine
PRs, the contract just carries the declaration.

## The CI gate (red-when-removed)
`scripts/check-portable-contract.sh` fails when:
1. any path in `git ls-files` does not resolve to exactly one class;
2. any `RELEASE_BUILD_INPUTS`/release-tree path resolves to `vault` or a deny rule
   (release must never ship user content);
3. the committed dist JSON differs from regeneration (drift gate, like
   check-contract-consistency.sh);
4. the contract JSON fails its schema.

## Resolution semantics
Longest-prefix rule wins; explicit file rules beat directory rules; deny beats all.
`resolve(path) -> {class, rule_id, deny: bool}`. Loader is pure stdlib (no pyyaml
dependency in the hot path — JSON only), mirroring `core/path_contract.py`.

## Non-goals for PR-0
No behavior change: nothing consumes the contract for writes yet. PR-1 (snapshot/journal
core) and the migrator/updater ports build on it. `ownership.json` CJS bridge is
deferred to PR-2 (generated view, only when the ported migrator needs it).
